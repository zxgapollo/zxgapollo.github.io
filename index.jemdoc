== Biography
Hi, I am seeking postdoc positions in universities of North America. I have obtained my Doctor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) on June 2022, supervised by Prof. Peilin Liu. Previous, I also got Masterâ€™s degree and Bachelor's degree from SJTU on March 2017 and June 2014.

Besides, I was a visiting fellow in Shanghai key lab of NSAI of Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Liang Song. Since June 2022, I am a research intern in Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab, supervised by Prof. Yanfeng Wang.

My research interests include computer vision applications in human action recognition, image retrieval, 3D reconstruction, and EEG signal classification. At present, I am focusing on the robust visual perception for safe autonomous driving.
